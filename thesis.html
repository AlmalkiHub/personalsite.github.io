		<h3>COVID-19 Fake News and Health Misinformation Detection on Twitter</h3>

			<h4>Project Overview</h4>

			<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, social networks have seen a substantial amount of false news. Furthermore,
				people have been discussing numerous false remedies to cure COVID-19. However, these remedies are
				extremely
				dangerous to human health.
				The director-general of the World Health Organisation calls it “infodemic" because of the amount of
				misinformation, disinformation, and "false news" relating to COVID-19.
				With the enormous number of news regarding COVID-19 on the Internet, it is difficult for many to assess
				truthfulness. Moreover, the riots and panic shopping also occurred due to the propagation of “false
				news".
			</p>
			<p>In this thesis project, I aim to build an automated COVID-19 misinformation detection system and
				investigate
				the value of a social network structure compared to the text-based classification approach. I have
				implemented a variety of techniques to detect fake news and misinformation in tweets related to
				COVID-19.
				The research objective is to classify each tweet as either true/fake with various text feature
				representations techniques and graph structure to compare and evaluate their performances. The project
				is
				comprised of two parts which are text-based and graph structure-based fake news detection techniques.
				For
				the first part, I conduct five different classification algorithms relying on various embeddings
				techniques including BoW, TF-IDF and Word2Vec embeddings. For the second part, I represent the data in a
				graph structure and learn the feature representations for the nodes using the Node2Vec embedding
				algorithm,
				which can then be used for the downstream classification task.</p>

			<p>The main achievements of the project are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>- I learnt how to clean and prepare large scale data in JSON format and convert it into a suitable
					format to be ready for the study analysis.
				</li> <br>
				<li>- I wrote a total of 18898 lines of source code (in Python), implementing all the experiments
					analysed
					in this thesis.</li> <br>
				<li>- I learnt how to build an NLP pipeline including word tokenisation and removing stop- words from
					the
					tweet text.
				</li> <br>
				<li>- I wrote functions in python code that encode different text feature representation includ- ing
					BoW,
					TF-IDF and Word2Vec.</li> <br>
				<li>- I investigated and trained many classification models with different feature representation
					combinations.</li> <br>
				<li>- I represented the data as a network structure (graph) and modelled it to be used in the context of
					detecting false information.</li> <br>
				<li>- I applied continuous feature representations for the nodes in a graph to be used for the
					classification task.</li> <br>
			</ul>

			<h4>Research Question</h4>

			<p>This project studies the value of both text and a social network structure for an automated
				misinformation
				detection system. The main research question to explore in this thesis – is misinformation better
				detected
				using text, or can the social network graph structure itself be a better detector?</p>
