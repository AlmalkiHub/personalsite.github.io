		<h3>The paradox of life</h3>



		<p>

			How odd it is! we know for sure that one day we will leave this life and everything will be over. Yes,
			everything will come to an end! Everything that made you sad, made you laugh, made you cry, concerned you,
			embarrassed you, discouraged you, killed your soul, and broke your heart. It will all be forgotten. </p>

		<p> There are 7.9 billion people in this world, the sad truth is that life will not stop because of your death,
			you will pass away as many before you did and you will be derelict, so why all this heavy thought that
			weighs on your conscience? you are always waiting for more and more and more to be happy and you will not
			stop waiting for more. Ease, contentment, and happiness lie within you, at this exact moment you just need
			to wake up from your deep sleep and realise this life-changing fact. Enjoy every small detail of your day
			and remember that it will not last forever. Your clock is ticking my friend! please never forget that.
			Forgive everyone and do not seek to please everyone because you did not and will not be able to. Time flies
			by, your day today is the future you were hoping for yesterday. Stop, close your eyes, breathe, you're still
			here! </p>
