        <h3> Night Thoughts üò¥</h3>


        <p>01:59 AM (01.01.2023)</p>

        <p>

            I was scrolling down my photo gallery and I found this photo of mine üëÜüèª a year ago. It took me back in time and
            I was overwhelmed with feelings as I felt what I was feeling at that moment. </p>

        <p> At the time I took this smily selfie I was going through severe depression and anxiety.
            A very dark time and I cannot put it into words. I do not really know how I was able to smile but thank god
            that I did.
            Lucky I am, the University of Bristol's well-being team took care of me and supported me all the way and I
            could not thank them enough. </p>

        <p> Yes, mental health is real and a serious matter especially in this time that we are living. Most people
            nowadays are still ashamed of it including me.
            A few dare to speak about it publicly due to its impact on their personal and professional lives as well, so
            they prefer not to and keep it to themselves.</p>

        <p> A few days ago, I heard the news of a girl's suicide and I felt extremely sad about her. I believe we live
            in a time where a deadly disease is killing many people around us and yet we do not seem to realize how
            dangerous and damaging it is until it is too late. </p>

     


        <p> I cannot seem to forget what I have been through during the pandemic. When you go through this, you will
            never be the same again. You will lose some pieces inside of you. With time you will fade away and worse.
        </p>

        <p> I would like to spread the word. I believe we live in a time like no other where a lot of people are
            mentally suffering in silence. I am sorry for being pessimistic here but we live in a greedy and awful
            world. People destroy each other to survive and they reassure themselves that they have done nothing in
            order to be able to sleep at night.
        </p>

        <p>I am thinking to start a podcast. I might make a confession about myself and start from there. I know deep
            down in my heart that I could make a difference in this shady world starting with myself first.</p>

        <p>The thing is that I am trying with all of my power to understand what is going on with me and why I keep
            going back to the same loop over and over again. I know I am being put to a test by Allah and I feel I am no
            longer able to keep on. Lots of heartbreaking moments that I cannot put into words at the moment. Maybe one
            day. I want to sleep now. Stay safe!</p>

        <p>Finally, If you are going through something please know that I love you and that I am here for you!</p>

        <p>(I hope no one is reading this. If you are, please pretend that you didn't. This is my personal space.
            Writing about what I feel helps me get things off my chest). </p>
