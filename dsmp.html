		<h4>Project Overview: </h4>
		<div class="img-container">
			<img src="images/lbg-logo.png">
			<p>The project deals with two synthetic datasets provided by Lloyds Banking Group (LBG) containing bank
				transactional data that is very similar to real-world data. Performing an exploratory data analysis on
				these datasets can help answer several compelling questions that could reveal useful insights for
				decision-makers, such as: understanding customer behaviour, average customer spending, identifying peak
				spending months, which shops have the highest spending and whether customers that spend more tend to
				transfer money to other people, who also spend more. </p>
			<p>Our main contribution is analysing two synthetic datasets, consisting of 13234863 million transactional
				records and 174601 transactional records, respectively.</p>
			<p> This dataset was combined with insights from the analysis, which included a dashboard, representing a
				detailed customer transaction for money payed into the customer's account and money paid out of the
				account, along with details of the counter-party to the transaction. </p>
			<p>We also applied unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, including data clustering and building a
				decision tree classification model, to classify customers into four different groups with similar
				characteristics, based on the customer's spending density and transfer frequency.</p>
			<p> We found that the customers with the highest spending frequency in terms of transactions had been
				spending their money in bars or pubs. Moreover, we found that customer spending increased at the start
				of the year (January) and at the end of the year (December).</p>
			<p> We concluded that banks should classify customers according to their profits and loyalty to the bank
				when recommending suitable financial products to them with corresponding service quality. To create this
				recommendation engine, we have built a classification model that divides all customers into four groups:
				the ordinary customer, loyal customer, potential valuable customer and priority customer.</p>
