		<h3>Large-Scale Data Engineering (LSDE) Coursework</h3>

		<p>In this unit coursework, I have done the following tasks:


		<h4>Task 1: A written task related to the knowledge gained in the AWS Academy Cloud Foundations course which was
			part of the unit curriculum to debate the statement: "Data is not safe on the Public Cloud".</h4>

		<h4>Task 2: A combined practical and written activity architecting a scaling application on AWS Cloud.</h4>
		<div class="img-container">
			<h5>Application Overview</h5>

			<p>WordFreq is a complete application designed using the Go programming language. Counting
				words in a text file is the basic feature of the programme. The top ten most common words in the
				document are returned. It has been migrated to AWS cloud using four main services connected
				with each other. The application runs on a virtual server (EC2 instance). Files are uploaded to
				AWS cloud via Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). When the files are uploaded
				successfully to S3 bucket, an alert is sent to the job queue on Simple Queue Service (SQS) where
				the application processes the available messages. Another results queue holds the top ten results
				of the processed jobs. Eventually, all the output results are loaded into a NoSQL database table
				(DynamoDB).</p>

			<h5>Auto-Scaling Design Architecture</h5>

			<p>The purpose of Auto-Scaling architecture is to allow the application to scale up and down to
				meet demand. So, at this stage my goal was to support the application to handle greater loads. I
				did this by trying to vertically scale the application. For example, increasing the size of the
				instance from t2.micro to t2.large. Also, horizontally scaling by increasing the number of
				instances for the WordFreq application. When setting up the auto-scaling architecture for the
				WordFreq application, first I created Cloudwatch alarms attached to scaling policies in the autoscaling
				group. The alarms' purpose is to be triggered once a threshold is breached to take the
				action of launching worker instances specified in the scaling policy. The scaling depends on the
				SQS jobs queue because that is where the messages are picked up by the consumer and get
				processed. The process here begins with uploading test files to S3 bucket, then, an eventnotification
				sends an alert to the jobs queue indicating that there are available messages ready to
				be processed.</p>

			<p>I have specified the threshold that if the average number of visible messages on the jobs queue is
				equal to or more than three messages for one data point within a minute, the scale-out alarm will
				be triggered to launch three servers for processing, and if there are no more messages remaining
				on the jobs queue, the scale-in alarm will be activated to leave no instances running for cost
				saving.</p>
