		<h3>Skim Literature (SkimLit) ðŸ“œ</h3>


		<h3>Project Description</h3>
		<p>In this project, I replicated the deep learning model behind the 2017 paper PubMed 200k RCT: a
			Dataset for Sequenctial Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts and adding further modelling
			experiments on my own. <br> <br>

			When it was released, the paper presented a new dataset called PubMed 200k RCT which consists of ~200,000
			labelled Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) abstracts. <br> <br>

			What is RCT? <br> <br>
			Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are prospective studies that measure the effectiveness of a new
			intervention or treatment. Although no study is likely on its own to prove causality, randomization reduces
			bias and provides a rigorous tool to examine cause-effect relationships between an intervention and outcome.
			<br> <br>

			The goal of the dataset was to explore the ability for NLP models to classify sentences which appear in
			sequential order. <br> <br>

			In other words, given the abstract of a RCT, what role does each sentence serve in the abstract?
